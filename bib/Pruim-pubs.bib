	abstract = { AbstractDiarrhoea is the second-leading cause of death in Liberia, a sub-Saharan African country of 4.8 million people, with a majority living in rural villages. Diarrhoea has often been linked with poor water quality and malnutrition. Three organisations partnered to distribute point-of-use (POU) water filters to every household in Liberia without other access to safe water, documenting the distribution of filters to 101,706 households. Each such household was surveyed at a baseline, two weeks, and eight weeks. In addition to household characteristics, the prevalence of diarrhoea was reported at each survey. Our goal was to determine the extent of the impact that POU filter use had on diarrhoea prevalence by age group, controlling for effects of water source, location, and household size. Overall, there was a 94.2\% decrease in diarrhoea cases from baseline to the 8-week follow-up. We discuss the success of the intervention in decreasing diarrhoea prevalence. The filter distribution focused on reaching remote villages, and providing access to clean water where there was none before. This study confirms that community-wide access to clean drinking water can reduce diarrhoea prevalence. },

@article{Dornbos:2012,
	abstract = {Application of glyphosate to cut stumps is broadly viewed as an effective way to control invasive woody shrubs like the buckthorn species (Rhamnus cathartica L. and Frangula alnus Mill.). Since the primary cost associated with this control method is labor, identifying factors that improve efficacy is important. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of glyphosate concentration and soil moisture on the control of buckthorn using the cut-stump method. More than 600 mature buckthorn plants were cut and treated with glyphosate at concentrations between 0 and 41% active ingredient during October in soils varying from dry to moist. While increased glyphosate concentration improved control rates, soil moisture played a dominant role. In moist soils, the impact of glyphosate concentration was insignificant (z=-1.723, p=0.085), and between 40% and 60% of treated buckthorn plants escaped control at all glyphosate concentrations. In dry soils, however, control rates increased significantly with higher concentrations of glyphosate (z=-8.84, p < 10--15), achieving up to 98% control with 41 % glyphosate. Root exudates of two three-year old field-grown buckthorn seedlings that were treated with high glyphosate concentrations in dry soils using cut-stump treatments contained detectable glyphosate comparable to control rates of mature plants. These results suggest that using the highest labeled concentration of herbicide in relatively dry soil conditions will provide optimum effectiveness with control rates up to 98%.},

	abstract = {The pattern and nature of linkage disequilibrium in the human
		genome is being studied and catalogued as part of the International
			HapMap Project [:2003 Nature 426:789-796]. A key goal of the HapMap
			Project is to enable identification of tag single nucleotide
			polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture a substantial portion of common
			human genetic variability while requiring only a small fraction of
			SNPs to be genotyped [International HapMap Consortium, 2005: Nature
			437:1299-1320]. In the current study, we examined the effectiveness
			of using the CEU HapMap database to select tag SNPs for a Finnish
			sample. We selected SNPs in a 17.9-Mb region of chromosome 14 based
			on pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) estimates from the HapMap
			CEU sample, and genotyped 956 of these SNPs in 1,425 Finnish
			individuals. An excess of SNPs showed significantly different
			allele frequencies between the HapMap CEU and the Finnish samples,
		consistent with population-specific differences. However, we observed
			strong correlations between the two samples for estimates of allele
			frequencies, r2 values, and haplotype frequencies. Our results
			demonstrate that the HapMap CEU samples provide an adequate basis
			for tag SNP selection in Finnish individuals, without the need to
				create a map specifically for the Finnish population, and
					suggest that the four-population HapMap data will provide
					useful information for tag SNP selection beyond the
					specific populations from which they were sampled. Genet.
